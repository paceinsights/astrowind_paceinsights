## The Same Questions, 40 Years Apart

The two things that really struck me are the exact questions and worries that the audience have, the underlying fears that they are articulating through their questions, are **exactly the ones that we're facing today**.

They're talking about computers, and here we're talking about implementation of AI. But this is from **1985** and still relevant today.

**There must be something to learn for us!**

## When Machines "Cheat"

What's interesting as well is the discussion about the bugs in the programme of the heuristics.

Especially where the computer looks to "cheat."

Anthropic are doing some research on this with their safety team, and they've published papers on how the AI has kind of cheated and done devious things in tests.

And both things mentioned here from 1985...

**But the thing is: it doesn't know any better. Is it cheating or not?**

## Intelligence Has Weaknesses

The throwaway comment at the end about it showing necessary weakness of intelligence is absolutely spot on and made me smile 😊

Hope you enjoy watching this as much as I did. Sometimes looking back helps us see forward more clearly.
