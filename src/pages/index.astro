        title: 'What does an AI strategy actually mean for my organisation?',
        description:
          'It means knowing where AI fits, what it can realistically do for you, and how to adopt it in a way that supports your team, workflows, and goals. It’s not a 5-year plan—it’s a mindset, a map, and a structured way to start building the future.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Why focus on building tools instead of just talking about strategy?',
        description:
          'Because clarity comes through doing. We build small, purposeful tools inside your business to test assumptions, build understanding, and identify what works. This isn’t about big-bang digital transformation. It’s about fast feedback and learning by doing.',

        title: 'What makes your approach different?',

          'We bring a performance mindset from motorsport—where decisions are made under pressure, and experimentation is constant. We help your business move quickly, do more with less, and evolve its systems through deliberate, lightweight tests.',

        title: 'How do we deal with how fast this technology is moving?',
        description:
          'We help you build systems that are modular and adaptable. When a better tool comes out next week (and it will), you won’t have to start over—you’ll be able to swap components in and out easily. Flexibility is designed in from day one.',

        title: 'Do you offer training for our team?',
        description:
          'Yes. We run hands-on workshops called “Talking to Robots”—designed to upskill your team using our AI Literacy Ladder and other frameworks we’ve developed to support confident, structured adoption. These are tailored for leadership, teams, or whole organisations.',

        title: 'Can you help us manage the impact of AI on our people and culture?',

          'Yes. In fact, it’s critical. AI adoption often brings fear, uncertainty, and resistance. From our experience introducing data analytics into Olympic sports teams—where change was initially unwelcome—we know how to guide cultural transformation with care and clarity.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Why do you talk about AI Agents like they’re staff?',
        description:
          'Because that’s how they behave. They arrive almost job-ready—but like any new hire, they need onboarding, training, feedback, and clear boundaries. Over time, we evolve their roles, grow your confidence, and even help these agents collaborate with each other as teams. Don’t worry—it sounds scary, but we’re here to look after you.',

        description:
          'Our approach is built around deliberate experimentation. Every tool or workflow we develop is designed to teach you something—not just work technically, but reveal insight. Sometimes we hit the goal first time. Sometimes we don’t. But we always learn—and learning is the real success. There’s no universal playbook for AI. Our job is to help you distil what matters, avoid the noise, and move forward with confidence.',

      {
        title: 'What does success look like in this kind of work?',
        description:
          'In the beginning, success means learning. We treat the first phase of work like a research lab—a place to experiment, explore, and build confidence in both the technology and where it fits within your organisation.\n\nFrom there, we help you scale what works—moving into a factory mindset where AI tools go into broader use across teams. That shift comes with more visibility, higher returns, and sometimes more risk. But by then, you’ll have the capability, culture, and clarity to handle it.\n\nAnd this isn’t “one and done.” Continuous improvement is built into everything we do. Our job is to make sure your business becomes smarter, more adaptable, and more efficient—not just through what we build, but through how we help you think.\n\nWhether you stay with us, grow your own internal capability, or later bring in a larger partner—that’s completely fine. We’re here to get you confidently started and set your business off in the best possible direction.',
